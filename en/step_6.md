## Adding pictures

Let's add a picture!

- Go to the tab named `index.html`. Find the `</main>` tag and type the following above it: 

```html
    <img src="tito.png" alt="Tito the dog" width="100px" />
```

Here's what the result should look like:

Notice that this tag has extra bits of information inside it. They are called **attributes**.

- Find the bit of code that says `width="100px"` and try experimenting with different numbers to see if you can figure out what this **attribute** does. Don't delete the letters `px`!

Notice that the `<img>` tag is different from the other tags you've used so far: 

There is no closing `</img>` tag. Instead it is **self closing**: the opening tag has `/>` at the end. This is because there is no "start" and "end" like there is when you are putting text on the page. 

The tag contains extra pieces of information inside it called **attributes**. 
- The `src` attribute tells the browser what file to use for the picture. 
- The `alt` attribute is a short description that the browser will show if it cannot display the picture. It also helps people using a screen reader to know what the picture is.
- The `width` attribute tells the browser how wide to make the picture. `100px` means one hundred **pixels**, the teeny-tiny dots that make up your screen. If you don't include this attribute, the picture will be displayed in its original size.

Now that you know the code to put a picture on your website, you probably want to change the picture, right?

- The first thing you will need is a picture! You can either use one you've already got on your computer, such as a photograph you took, or you can get one from the internet.

Once you have a picture, you will **upload** the file to Trinket: 

- In your Trinket, click on the image icon next to the **+** sign.

This is where you can see the pictures that can be used on your website. You should see the picture of Tito the CoderDojo dog.

- Click the button **Add Image** and then click **Upload**. 

- Click on the button **Click To Select Files**. Find your picture and double click on it. 

- Click **Done**.

Your picture is uploaded and ready to use!

- Go to the file index.html and find the `<img>` tag. Change the text `tito.png` so that it exactly matches the name of the file with your picture. Note that it might end in `.jpg` instead of `.png`!

The text you just changed is the **attribute** called `src`. It tells the browser what file to display.

**Important:** The value you type for an **attribute** must have quotation marks around it!

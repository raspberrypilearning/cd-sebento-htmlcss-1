## Making a menu bar

On this card you will see how you can transform your navigation menu into a cool looking menu bar just by adding more **CSS** rules in the stylesheet.

- Go to the stylesheet file. Remember it is in the `styles.css` tab. Click **after** a closing curly brace `}` and press enter to go onto a new line. Add the following rule:

```css
    nav ul {
        background-color: tomato;
    }
```

Notice how you used **two selectors** instead of one? If you used the `ul` selector on its own, the rule would affect all unordered lists on your website. Adding the `nav` selector as well makes it only apply to lists that are in between `nav` tags.

Let's get rid of the bullet points. Those are the spots in front of each list item. 

- Go to the `styles.css` tab and add the following to the file. Again, type it on a new line after a `}` so it's not accidentally inside any other block of rules.

```css
    nav ul li {
        list-style-type: none;
    }
```

Notice this set of rules has **three** selectors! It selects all `li` elements that are in a `ul` list which is inside a `nav` section. Phew!

Now let's make the list horizontal \(across\) instead of vertical \(down\). 

- Inside the new set of rules, add the following line: `display: inline;` ![](images/egMenuBarInline.png) 
 
- The menu items are all squashed together, so let's also add the properties `margin-right` and `margin-left` to space them out a bit. The rules should look like this now:

```css
    nav ul li {
        list-style-type: none;
        display: inline;
        margin-right: 10px;
        margin-left: 10px;
    }
```
   
Remember `10px` means ten **pixels**.

How about making the menu change to to tell you which page you are on? This part won't be in the stylesheet.

- Start with the homepage. Go to the `index.html` file. In the list, remove the link tags before and after the word `Home`, so that the **list item** for the homepage is just text in between `<li> </li>` tags, like this: `<li>Home</li>`.

- Now go to each of your other files, and do the same thing, each time removing the link tags for the page you are editing. So, for example, on the `music.html` file, I've removed the link tags in the `Music` list item, and so on.

```html
    <header>
        <nav>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="attractions.html">Attractions</a></li>
            <li>Music</li>
            <li><a href="food.html">Food</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
```

- Explore your pages by clicking the links. See how the menu bar shows the page you're on as plain text instead of a link?

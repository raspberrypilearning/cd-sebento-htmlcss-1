## Adding more pages

This card will show you how to add more pages to your website.

- At the top of the code panel, click on the **+** symbol next to the tabs and type in a name for your new file. It must end in `.html` \(including the dot!\) so that the browser knows it's a web page.

If you want to change the name of a file, click on the cog icon to the right of the filename, and click the pencil. Type in the new name and press Enter. You can also delete a file by clicking the bin icon instead of the pencil.

You might be wondering why you can't change the name of the `index.html` file. `index.html` is a special name used for the **homepage** of a website. That's the first page you land on when you visit a website. When you go to a website's homepage, the browser looks for the file called `index.html` and displays it on your screen.

- Find the file `blank_page.html` and **copy** and **paste** all of the code from it into your new file.

- Go the the file blank\_page.html in the code panel \(by clicking on the tab with that name\). Select all of the text in the file by doing the following: Click anywhere on the code, then press and hold the `Ctrl` key \(or if you are using a Mac, the `cmd` key\) and while holding it, press the `A` key at the same time. Notice how all the text becomes highlighted.

- Now, with the text selected, press and hold the `Ctrl` \(or `cmd`\) key again and then while holding it press the `C` key. This **copies** everything that was selected.

- Go to your new file and click inside the code panel \(which is blank at the moment\). Press and hold the `Ctrl` \(or `cmd`\) key and then while holding it, press the `V` key. This **pastes** everything that was copied into your new page.

  You can use these keyboard shortcuts in most programs to **copy** and **paste** stuff, including text and files!

- Change the text in between the `<title> </title>` tags so your new page has a suitable title. Trinket won't display the title, but you'll see it at the top of your browser window if you download your project.

- In between the `<main> </main>` tags in the new file, use the tags you have learned to add stuff to the page, such as paragraphs, headings, images and lists!

- Repeat the steps above for each new page that you want to add. 

- When there are too many tabs to be able to see them all, you can use the **<** and **>** icons in the top left corner of the tabs to scroll between them.

Now you need to make links so that you can get to each of your new pages! Let's put all the links in a list.

- In the `index.html` file, add the following code:

```html
    <ul>
        <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="attractions.html">Places to visit</a></li>
        <li><a href="music.html">Music</a></li>
        <li><a href="food.html">Things to eat</a></li>
    </ul>
```

- Change the value of the `href` **attribute** for each link \(rememeber, that's the text inside the quotation marks\) so that it exactly matches the name of each new file that you created. 

- Change the text in between the `<a> </a>` tags to suitable descriptions of your pages.

Now you can navigate to your new pages!

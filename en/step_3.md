## Getting setup

- Go to [dojo.soy/html-b-start](http://dojo.soy/html-b-start). You will see a box containing an example website project. On the right hand side is the website, and on the left hand side is the code that makes the website.

- Click the "Remix" button at the top right of the project \(if you are not signed in, you will be prompted to do so. Once you've signed in you will then need to click the Remix button again\). This creates a copy of the project for you to work with.

It should say "remixed" after you click it:

You can save your work by using one of the options in the **Share** menu. You will get a link that you can either store somewhere, for example, in a document or send to someone via email.
Note: each time you make a change, you will get a new link.

If you want to create an account on Trinket, follow the steps below. This will allow you to access your work easily from any computer, and to **Remix** a project somebody else has shared with you (i.e. save a copy so you can make your own changes to it).


- Go to [dojo.soy/trinket](http://dojo.soy/trinket) and click "Sign Up For Your Free Account" if you do not already have an account. You will need an email address to sign up. 

- Enter your email address and choose a password, or ask somebody to do this for you.

- You can now access all your saved or remixed projects by clicking on your username and going to "My Trinkets".
